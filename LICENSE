•	Align incentives: By requiring AE staking, Hyperchains become economically tied to the Aeternity ecosystem.
•	Foster collaboration: AENS names create a standardized way to identify and integrate Hyperchains.
•	Sustain the ecosystem: Redistributing fees to buy and stake AE ensures Hyperchains strengthen the mainnet.
•	To launch your Hyperchain, you must stake a minimum amount of AE tokens on the Aeternity mainnet.
•	This stake secures your chain and ties its success to the health of the mainnet.
Hyperchains must automatically allocate a portion of transaction fees to buy AE tokens on the mainnet.
•	These AE tokens are then staked to further secure the chain and contribute to the ecosystem.
Every Hyperchain must register a unique identity through the Aeternity Naming System (AENS).
•	For example, you might register myhyperchain.chain to serve as your official chain name, ensuring discoverability and preventing conflicts.
•	Hyperchains must maintain their AE stake and adhere to the fee redistribution rules.
•	Non-compliance (e.g., failing to stake or redistribute fees) could lead to the revocation of your license.
